This is a game kit which gives you an API to make Adventure, RPG, RTS
and RPG games are all-in-one.

Almost every class of the API can be overrided to provide you with game
mechanics without a drawing system or using ncurses (terminal drawing.)

There is an separate package for doing the Game's AI. In the first place
you do not need AI but you can steer this by using the update methods in
sprites, enemies and so on. If you really want heavier AI than
conditions and clauses in an update method
you need to have the package Holly6GameAI which should be found at
http://holyghost.yellowcouch.org

Derived packages of games can also be found there.
